# snow-crash

A small project for checking out security problems in CS.
This project consist of 14 levels.
They make you learn Linux, PHP, C, Assembler, LUA, Perl.
Each level is a CTF task.

The solutions are presented in `levelXX` folders.
In each folder there is a `flag` file (a solution) and a `Ressources/README.md`, where I list my process of solving the level.
